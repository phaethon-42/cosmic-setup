# Cosmic Encounter setup

This is a basic project to ease the setup for the game Cosmic Encounter.

## Basic flow

1. Each player logs in (providing your name is sufficient)
1. The server chooses 2 races for you randomly
1. Each player must choose one of the races
1. One of the players chooses to reveal the options and choices of all players (after which, no changes can be made and no new players may join)
1. Setup the game, play it, then start a new one

## Current limitation

1. Only one game can be in progress
1. No user authentication
1. Everyone can choose to reveal the players' choices at any time (even if not all players chose a race yet)
1. The races' images (with text and abilities) aren't displayed yet, names only
